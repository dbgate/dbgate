# Instructions for Testing the DB2 Plugin Fixes

## Manual Testing Steps

1. Start the DbGate application with your DB2 connection
2. Connect to your DB2 database using the connection dialog
3. Verify that the connection establishes successfully (even with intermittent connectivity)
4. Navigate to the Functions section in the database explorer
5. Verify that functions are correctly retrieved and displayed
6. Check the console logs for any errors related to RETURNS/RETURN_TYPE columns

## Automated Testing

You can run the included test script to verify basic functionality:

```powershell
# Navigate to the plugin directory
cd "d:\Yamany Task\dbGate-new\dbgate\plugins\dbgate-plugin-db2"

# Run the test script (you'll need to edit the connection details first)
node test-db2-driver.js
```

## Expected Results

1. Successful connection to DB2 database
2. Functions should be retrieved correctly
3. No errors related to RETURNS keyword
4. Stable connection even with intermittent network conditions

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist, check the console logs for detailed error messages. The enhanced error handling should provide specific information about what's failing and why.

For connection issues, verify your network connectivity and DB2 server status. The plugin now has better retry logic, but it can't overcome persistent network problems.

For function retrieval issues, verify that your DB2 server has the expected catalog views and column names. The plugin now tries multiple approaches, but some DB2 versions might have different schema structures.
