# DB2 Plugin Fixes

This document outlines the issues fixed in the DB2 plugin for dbGate.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Schema List Endpoint Hanging Issue

**Problem:** The `/database-connections/schema-list` endpoint was hanging indefinitely, causing the UI to become unresponsive.

**Root Cause:** 
- Missing implementation of `_refreshSchemaCounts` method
- Inefficient query for loading schema counts that could time out or hang
- No timeout protection in queries

**Solution:**
- Implemented the missing `_refreshSchemaCounts` method in `fixSchemaListIssue.js`
- Added progressive schema loading strategy:
  1. First load schema list without counts (fast)
  2. Then load counts in the background (without blocking UI)
- Added timeout protection for queries
- Added schema caching to improve performance

### 2. Table Counts Display Issues

**Problem:** The table counts in schema dropdowns displayed incorrectly or were missing.

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect handling of count results from DB2
- Case sensitivity issues with column names
- Missing error handling for failed count queries

**Solution:**
- Improved count query handling with case-insensitive field access
- Added proper error handling for failed count queries
- Implemented caching for count results to improve performance
- Fixed data type handling to ensure counts are always numbers

### 3. SQL Select Endpoint Hanging and Errors

**Problem:** The `/database-connections/sql-select` endpoint was hanging and failing with errors like "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')".

**Root Cause:**
- Bug in `_detectQueryType` method when handling non-string SQL input
- Lack of proper validation in query method
- Missing error handling for edge cases

**Solution:**
- Fixed the `_detectQueryType` method to safely handle all input types
- Added comprehensive input validation in the `query` method
- Enhanced error handling to gracefully handle failures
- Added timeout protection for all queries

## Files Modified

- `driver.js` - Enhanced error handling and added missing methods
- `index.js` - Updated to apply all fixes during initialization
- `Analyser.js` - Fixed indentation and code completion issues

## Files Added

- `driver-fix.js` - Contains fixes for SQL endpoint issues
- `fixSchemaListIssue.js` - Implements schema list endpoint fixes
- `schemaHelper.js` - Helper functions for schema operations
- `cache-manager.js` - Caching implementation to improve performance
- `connection-manager.js` - Connection management utilities

## Testing

All fixes have been validated with the following test scripts:
- `test-all-db2-fixes.js` - Comprehensive tests for all fixes
- `test-sql-endpoint-fix.js` - Specific tests for SQL endpoint fixes
- `test-schema-fixes.js` - Specific tests for schema list fixes
- `verify-fixes.js` - Script to verify all fixes are in place

## How to Verify Fixes

Run the verification script:

```bash
node verify-fixes.js
```

This will check that all required files exist and run the test suite.

## Additional Improvements

- Added connection management for better handling of DB2 connections
- Implemented comprehensive logging for easier debugging
- Added fallbacks for various operations to improve resilience
- Enhanced performance through strategic caching
