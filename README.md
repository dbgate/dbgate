## How to contribute
Any contributions are welcome. If you want to contribute without coding, consider following:

* Tell your friends about DbGate or share on social networks - when more people will use DbGate, it will grow to be better
* Write review on [Slant.co](https://www.slant.co/improve/options/41086/~dbgate-review) or [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/dbgate/reviews) 
* Create issue, if you find problem in app, or you have idea to new feature. If issue already exists, you could leave comment on it, to prioritise most wanted issues
* Create some tutorial video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCo7KjCVXhr0RfUSjM9wJMsp_ShL1q61A)
* Become a backer on [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/dbgate) or [Open collective](https://opencollective.com/dbgate)
* Where a small coding is acceptable for you, you could [create plugin](https://dbgate.org/docs/plugin-development.html). Plugins for new themes can be created actually without JS coding

Thank you!

## Why is DbGate different
There are many database managers now, so why DbGate? 
* Works everywhere - Windows, Linux, Mac, Web browser (+mobile web is planned), without compromises in features
* Based on standalone NPM packages, scripts can be run without DbGate (example - [CSV export](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dbgate-plugin-csv) )
* Many data browsing functions based using foreign keys - master/detail, expand columns, expandable form view

## Design goals
* Application simplicity - DbGate takes the best and only the best from old DbGate, [DatAdmin](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Servers/Database-Utils/DatAdmin-Personal.shtml), [DbMouse](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Servers/Database-Utils/DbMouse.shtml) and [SQL Database Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Database_Studio)
* Minimal dependencies
    * Frontend - Svelte
    * Backend - NodeJs, ExpressJs, database connection drivers
    * JavaScript + TypeScript
    * App - electron
* Platform independent - runs as web application in single docker container on server, or as application using Electron platform on Linux, Windows and Mac

<!-- ## Plugins
Plugins are standard NPM packages published on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com).  
See all [existing DbGate plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:dbgateplugin).  
Visit [dbgate generator homepage](https://github.com/dbgate/generator-dbgate) to see, how to create your own plugin.  

Currently following extensions can be implemented using plugins:
- File format parsers/writers
- Database engine connectors

Basic set of plugins is part of DbGate git repository and is installed with app. Additional plugins pust be downloaded from NPM (this task is handled by DbGate) -->

## How to run development environment

Simple variant - runs WEB application:
```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

If you want more control, run WEB application:
```sh
yarn # install NPM packages
```

And than run following 3 commands concurrently in 3 terminals:
```
yarn start:api # run API on port 3000
yarn start:web # run web on port 5001
yarn lib # watch typescript libraries and plugins modifications
```
This runs API on port 3000 and web application on port 5001  
Open http://localhost:5001 in your browser

If you want to run electron app:
```sh
yarn # install NPM packages
cd app
yarn # install NPM packages for electron
```

And than run following 3 commands concurrently in 3 terminals:
```
yarn start:web # run web on port 5001 (only static JS and HTML files)
yarn lib # watch typescript libraries and plugins modifications
yarn start:app # run electron app
```

## How to run built electron app locally
This mode is very similar to production run of electron app. Electron doesn't use localhost:5001.

```sh
cd app
yarn
```

```sh
yarn
yarn build:app:local
yarn start:app:local
```

## How to create plugin
Creating plugin is described in [documentation](https://github.com/dbgate/dbgate/wiki/Plugin-development)

But it is very simple:

```sh
npm install -g yo # install yeoman
npm install -g generator-dbgate # install dbgate generator
cd dbgate-plugin-my-new-plugin # this directory is created by wizard, edit, what you need to change
yarn plugin # this compiles plugin and copies it into existing DbGate installation
```

After restarting DbGate, you could use your new plugin from DbGate.

## Logging
DbGate uses [pinomin logger](https://github.com/dbgate/pinomin). So by default, it produces JSON log messages into console and log files. If you want to see formatted logs, please use [pino-pretty](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty) log formatter.
